Unpacked Chrome Extension

Clicking on the scrabble icon in the address bar will load it, add board tiles to the text bar that you want to play off of.  

Clicking scrobble will search the dictionary for playable words off the "board" tiles.

After playing a word, you'll have to reload the extension to bring back the scrobble button.
